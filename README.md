# Day-One-XML-to-Markdown-Converter
PHP script to convert DayOne entries to separate .md files

I wanted to export DayOne entries as individual files, but didn't want to export each entry one at a time. I used this script to convert all the DayOne XML data files to Markdown. I left in some of my debugging code. Feel free to use this to build your own converter.

 Notes:
 * 	- uses .doentry file extension, but can be changed in settings at top of file
 * 	- Destination folder  must have write permissions
